             * The weighting is on a heavily customized cubic curve. It looks like this: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(9.5((x-0.5)%5E3))%2B(2x%2F3)%5E2-0.3+from+0+to+1
             * The maximum positive weight is 1.27x. The maximum negative weight is -1.4875x. The neutral weight (0x) is at an opinion diff of 0.706.
             * This means that to have a positive thought from a conversation, pawns need to have a <31% difference in personality on that topic.
             * However, since it's a cubic curve, the negative modifier builds gradually. Pawns will need a >79% difference in personality to have a -0.5x weight.
             * But they'll also need a <23% difference to have a 0.5x weight. Normal agreement is at ~0.962, and normal disagreement is at ~0.073.
             * Pawns are unlikely to have huge differences in opinion. There are more ways for them to be close to each other than far apart. Here's the proof: https://anydice.com/program/1177b4
             * The approximate likelihood for them to agree on something with this weighting is 49.89%.
             * 
             * Pawns' differences are exacerbated when they are in a relationship, but their similarities are also magnified.
             * The neutral conversation weight (0x) moves from 0.706 to 0.759, so the threshold for agreement is ~5% higher.
             * Normal disagreement moves from 0.073 to 0.127, and normal agreement moves from 0.962 to 0.946.
             * The maximum positive weight moves from 1.27x to 1.4986x. The maximum negative weight moves from -1.425x to -1.9875x.
             * The approximate likelihood for them to agree on something with this weighting is 42.63%.
